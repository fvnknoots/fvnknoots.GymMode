GymMode
================================================================================

Beginner-friendly Northstar server mod, where your maximum HP adjusts at every kill and death.

If a match has only beginners or average players in it,
most players will float around 80-120 HP.
If a veteran player joins the match, others get more HP after deaths,
while the veteran player can end up with very low HP.
This means the beginners can still practice the game,
while the veteran player has to practice better movement to avoid dying,
and better aim to kill the high-HP enemies.

Default settings
